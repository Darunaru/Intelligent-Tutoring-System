## **WHAT IS INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM?**

Intelligent tutors are able to provide a personalized approach to learning by considering the role of a real teacher or expert who adapts and conduct the learning process according to the specific needs of each learner. Web courseware is easily accessible and offers greater flexibility, that is, students can control their own pace of study. Candidate would start the assessment with combinations of questions and it is tested using Natural Language Processing and supervised machine learning algorithm classifies the users. Based on the classification the algorithm decides whether he should be given access to module or he should attain some basics for the course.


## **WHY INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEM SHOULD BE USED?**

- Reduces geographical barriers, so the time and cost will be reduced for gaining knowledge.
- Intelligent tutoring systems can provide students with experiences similar to those provided by a tutor, but at a fraction of the cost.
- In a traditional educational setting, providing a tutor for each student may be ideal, but certainly is not plausible in terms of physical space and financial constraints.
- The data collected by each user can be useful for finding new patterns in future.
They allow searching the student level of knowledge and learning strategies used to increase or correct the student's knowledge. They are intended to support and improve the teaching and learning process in a selected area of knowledge while respecting the individuality of the learner.
- Intelligent tutoring systems are expensive both to develop and implement. The research phase paves the way for the development of systems that are commercially viable.
-Most tutoring systems are currently unable to detect shallow learning, or to distinguish between productive versus unproductive struggle, for example while giving control over the ability to receive hints.
-Majority of tutoring system focuses only on a single domain and the studentâ€™s knowledge is not gained fully before the start of the course.
